# zapallo

Zapallo is a generic social networking API that allows site builders to build
sites that use spring based security and Spring Web Flow. The responsibility
of the library include account creation, security and deletion as well as
profile management and graph data. The library has a long way to go before it
is production ready and contributors are welcome.

The library expects that the calling application will introduce a 
Drools Business Rules Engine (BRE) to handle business logic.
